Built a fine-grained BBC News categorization system covering over 200 subcategories. Leveraged topic modelling to discover latent themes, large language models to classify news articles into subtopics, and named-entity recognition to assign roles. Added summarization and trending news exploration features. The pipeline spans data processing, model training, evaluation, and a usable interface, achieving high classification performance.
