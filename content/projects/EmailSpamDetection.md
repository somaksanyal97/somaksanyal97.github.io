Built a robust email spam classifier to differentiate between spam and ham emails. Key features include data cleaning, text preprocessing using CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer, oversampling using SMOTE to handle class imbalance, training multiple models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) with hyperparameter tuning, and evaluating on metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall. Achieved high precision for spam detection across models. Included interactive dashboards to analyze misclassifications.
